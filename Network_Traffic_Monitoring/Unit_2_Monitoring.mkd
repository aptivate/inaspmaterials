### Traffic Graphing â€“ Good Story

![Traffic graph of a well-managed busy network.
	<span style="color: green;">Green = incoming</span>, 
	<span style="color: blue;">Blue = Outgoing</span>.](../static/traffic-graph-good.png)

On this graph you can see that:

* Maximum traffic load of 12.4 Mbps
* The circuit is symmetric
* The connection is not overloaded

.. class:: handout

Problems caused by poor network management:

* Difficulties in using Internet based information resources and communication tools

    - Digital library resources are under utilised
    - Resource license costs can be less effective
    - Free or low cost resources are difficult to take advantage of
    - The digital library revolution is difficult to participate in
    - Continued digital divide

* Under utilisation of ICT capacities and investments

    - Bandwidth charges of $5,000 per month that result in an unusable link –
      is that money well spent?
    - Infrastructure costs e.g. PC computer labs that users spend most
      of their time sitting around waiting for pages to display – is
      that money well spent?

* Impacts on a university’s core activities, especially
  those that require up to date and a wide range of information
  resources e.g. teaching and research.

Skilled staff leaving the university makes life very difficult for them.
Do everything possible to reduce/avoid it!

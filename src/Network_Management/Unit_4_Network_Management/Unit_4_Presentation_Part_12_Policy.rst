Policy and Behaviour
--------------------

Technical measures alone fail to change behaviour. Why?

"5% of users use 50% of the traffic, so 95% should be on your side."
Discuss.

A hint:

* Who has authority to create policy?
* Who has authority to implement technical measures?
* Who do users fear more?
* Whose side are the users on? What do they want?

Consider your Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). That means you have to find a
copy of it. How easy or hard is it? Ask the next person you see to find
your policy. Or even better, to explain it to you!

We have a whole session on policies, as well as a separate Policy
Development workshop (TODO link to it).

For now, consider how well your users understand your policy. Test them.
Test the next person you see: is action X allowed by the policy or not?

How is your policy enforced, by who, and how well? Who follows the policy,
who fights against it? How could you get them on side?

It's been said that "5% of users use 50% of the traffic, so 95% should be
on your side." Do you agree? How many people abuse your network or cause
problems for you? Do the others understand the problem and the benefits
of reasonable, fair use? If not, how would you show them?

Who is responsible?
-------------------

Who needs to be involved in network management, and why?

-  Executive management
-  Senior IT management
-  Technical staff involved in the day-to-day implementation
-  Academics, librarians and other legitimate Internet users

What roles do they play in managing a network?

Executive management
	have the power to create or change policy and budgets.
Senior IT management
	bridge the gap between staff on the ground, executives and the rest
	of the university.
Technical staff
	have the skills to understand the problem, implement changes, and
	identify policy violations.
Legitimate Internet users
	are the reason why the University pays so much for its Internet
	connection and the IT department. They are your customers!

Disaster Response
-----------------

* What disasters might happen to your network?
* How would you cope with them?

.. class:: handout

Plan for destruction of all your equipment by fire or theft:

* How long would it take you to recover?
* What does your insurance cover you for?
* How much would it cost?
* How would you respond?
* Can you have a backup/alternate system in place quickly?

Keep backups of all servers and practise restoring a server every year.

From the e-book `How to Accelerate your Internet <http://bwmo.net/>`_:

Make regular backups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Over time your network configuration will grow and expand to suit your
particular network. Remembering the intricate details will become impossible
making it very difficult to reproduce the same configuration if it is lost.

Making regular backups ensures that you can rebuild your configuration from
scratch if required. Having multiple backups means you can roll back to a
previous known working state if a configuration change goes awry.

Disaster plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Technology is not always as reliable as we hope, and it is a certainty that
at some point major problems will strike your network. By planning for these,
and having a procedure in place for dealing with them, you will be in a far
better situation when the lights go off!

Fallback network mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is useful to prepare a basic network configuration state, which only
allows a minimum set of services on a network. When a problem occurs which
stops the network from functioning effectively you can implement this
fallback mode, allowing others to use essential services whilst you are
troubleshooting the problem.

Saving time with Automation
---------------------------

There are infinite possible problems:

* Checking for them takes time
* Risk = Hazard x Vulnerability --- Capacity
* Prioritise your time (tickets or cards)
* Automate everything you can

If you have a tool that gives you a *yes or no* answer, *is there a problem
or not*, then you can automate the use of that tool to generate alerts
automatically as soon as a problem occurs.

Automated fault detection is difficult - but not impossible! Tools already
exist to detect most faults in an automated way, if you can work out how to
use them.

Look at your list of faults, and identify how you could get a
*yes/no answer* about whether the fault exists. Use the Internet or
brainstorm in a group to generate ideas.

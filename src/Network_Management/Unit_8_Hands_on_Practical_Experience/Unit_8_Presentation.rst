If you are the facilitator, please tell the group: 

	At the end of session I will ask if we have met the objectives – if not,
	we will discuss again.

Spend some time watching and doing
----------------------------------

* Use existing Microsoft Tools on XP (command line)
* Install and use Wireshark or one of the other Windows based capture tools
* Use standard Linux commands from a Linux Live CD
* Use the `Kali Linux <http://www.kali.org/>`_ Live CD for penetration testing

Discuss timetable for the day.

This is your session so do ask questions, raise hands, so we can explore
the methods we use and reinforce methods.

Everyone participant must have installed a package using the tool, today or
tomorrow. That way you know you can do it again with no help.

I will first demonstrate, and then everyone will have a go installing by
themselves. Use a token to indicate who is installing.

Software used:

Knoppix
	able to be loaded on any PC – prime intent to provide a live CD to be
	used anywhere like an Internet café.
Ubuntu
	provides open source desktop functionality for the African community.
	If you are considering installing a computer lab or you don’t want to
	buy any Microsoft software, but you still want to read Word and
	PowerPoint files, this has Microsoft functionality. I.e. designer
	knock offs. This is totally free to download from www.ubuntu.org.
Auditor Security
	security probe software that you can use.

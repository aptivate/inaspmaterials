Unit 10: Policy Development 
===========================

Facilitator notes
-----------------

.. include:: ../includes/Authors.rst

This document outlines any actions the facilitator needs to take prior to the workshop to make sure participants carry out pre-workshop activities. This, in turn, allows for more focused exercises during the workshop.

Before the Workshop
===================

Before the workshop, the facilitator will ask participants to identify their AUP (Acceptable Use Policy) document, or lack of it.

In Part 2, participants who have identified their AUP will identify its strengths and weaknesses, and indicate areas for improvement. Participants who have acknowledged the lack of an AUP within their institution will analyse AUP documents provided by the facilitator, identify their strengths and weaknesses and draft the structure of their new AUP document.

A sample email that the facilitator can use to ask workshop participants to identify their AUP document is included in the next section. Such an email should ideally be sent about two weeks before the workshop.   

How to: Sample email
--------------------

	Dear WORKSHOP ORGANISER (person in charge or invitations and participants selection),

	In preparation for the forthcoming bandwidth management and optimisation workshop and in particular the policy part of the workshop, please could you send a copy of the attached PDF document to all of the confirmed participants of the policy part of the workshop. Could this be done as soon as possible so that people can take the appropriate actions in advance of the workshop.

	If you have any questions then please let me know.

	Thanks,

	Attached: `acceptable-use-policy-request.doc <acceptable-use-policy-request.doc>`_ or 
	`acceptable-use-policy-request.pdf <acceptable-use-policy-request.pdf>`_.

Note: you need to personalise the above document by updating the dates and location of the workshop in question.

The State of Nature Game
========================

An ice-breaker group exercise to learn about public goods.

On completion of this session the learner will have:

* Interacted among themselves
* Reflected on the nature of problems of collective choice and what the implications for bandwidth management are

Introduction
------------

“Public goods” is a term used by economists, especially public policy
economists. The term itself has a complex definition, but for our
purposes we will define a public good as:

	any good that the members of a community benefit from, irrespective of whether they have contributed to it, and which they can consume in arbitrary amounts – that is, as much or as little as they wish to. 

Public goods are invariably subject to abuse by “free riders” who 
over-consume them at the expense of the community. Analysis shows that a
rational self-interested individual will choose to be a free rider in the
absence of mechanisms to regulate access to a public good: hence the
importance of developing such mechanisms, whether they be technical or
policy-based. Without such mechanisms, it is extremely difficult for a
community to regulate access by itself. This initial exercise shows how
communities struggle with this problem, and how they usually arrive at
outcomes that are not in the general interest.

Rules
-----

This game was originally developed by Michael Taylor. The only materials needed to play it are some toy money of the kind used in the game Monopoly. The amount needed is 200 dollars per person. 100 dollars is given to each player and the bank retains the rest – it will be used during play. The game’s rules are:

* The game is played in a series of rounds. Each round has two phases.
* In phase 1 of a round, each player must pay ten dollars into a pool. This
  amount is the "survival cost" for the round, and any player who cannot pay
  it is deemed to have died and takes no further part in the game.
* The bank contributes an equal amount to the pool – thus, if twenty players
  each pay a survival cost of ten dollars, the initial pool is 200 dollars;
  the bank adds another 200 dollars, so the pool becomes 400 dollars.
* In phase 2 of a round, the entire pool is auctioned to the highest bidder.
  A special feature of the auction however, is that the winner wins not only
  the pool, but also the bids of every other player. A player who makes a bid
  has effectively lost it and can only recover it by winning the auction.
* Only individuals may bid. They may however borrow money from others.
* To better another player’s bid, a player must bid more: an equal bid is not
  good enough.
* Any agreement among players is permitted, but no agreements are binding.

Discussion
----------

Once the game is complete, participants should discuss the following:

* What outcome is in the best interests of all the members of the group?
* How could the group have achieved this outcome, if it didn’t do so?

Analysis
--------

Whenever this game is played with a sufficiently large group - say ten
or more - it almost always follows the same pattern. Once the bidding for
the first round opens, nobody is keen to bid - they are unsure of the
implications and the risk. But inevitably, some brave soul bids a dollar.
Others see the prospect of the first bidder walking away with the entire
pool - which is a substantial amount of money - and they proceed to make
competitive bids, initially small, but progressively larger. Since all
bids are lost, bidders rapidly acquire a vested interest in winning!

Sooner or later one of the bidders will have bid all of his or her money -
ninety dollars, since the initial allocation was 100, and ten went into the
pool. At this point they can't be outbid by any player in isolation - nobody
has more than ninety dollars. At this point consortia begin to emerge - one
player will borrow from another, and competing bidders will do the same thing.

In a typical game, two strong consortia might emerge; or only a single
consortium, with all the other players acting in isolation, or perhaps in
weak consortia. Such consortia invariably form around geographical locality:
that is, players sitting next to one another consort, overriding other
interests (such as people from the same institution forming a consortium).
This is because negotiation is simply much easier with the person in the next seat!

Since no agreements are binding, a consortium faces the risk that the
individual who bids on its behalf (remember that only individuals may bid)
will not share the proceeds with the rest. If this happens then the
consortium dissolves and its former members will try to punish the defector
by entering into new consortia. (Remember that a player who is not winning
money is steadily running down his initial allocation, and will eventually
die). 

Sometimes a single consortium will emerge and the rest of the group will
see the threat that they face - i.e. being bid out of existence - and they
will combine to resist. But they also face the same problem as any
consortium, i.e. will the individual who bids share the proceeds?

The rational solution for the group as a whole is not to compete among itself.
Since than bank is contributing at every turn, each individual could be
getting progressively wealthier (by ten dollars a round) if a collective
agreement could be reached. A rational agreement would be to nominate one
bidder, who bids one dollar, wins the pool, and redistributes it. (But of
course, the same risk of free riding applies in this case.)

The game's outcome cannot be predicted in advance - it can be wildly unstable -
but one of the outcomes above is quite typical. It is tremendous fun to play.

Conclusion
----------

The purpose of this game has been (a) to get the group to interact among
itself and feel comfortable with itself, and (b) to demonstrate how problems
of collective choice are difficult to solve. Since bandwidth is a public good
– it is subject to abuse by free riders, who are acting in their own rational
best interest – we need mechanisms to manage it for the good of all.

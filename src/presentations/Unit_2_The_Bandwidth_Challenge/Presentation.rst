Unit 2: The Bandwidth Challenge
===============================

.. include:: ../../includes/Authors.rst

.. class:: handout

Objectives
----------

On completion of this session, we hope you will:

* Understand how and why African universities face challenges with:

    * available bandwidth
    * network performance
    * effectiveness of IT spending
    * resulting impact on academic objectives

* Understand the benefits of excellent network management.

* Know how these issues are currently being addressed in your own and other
  organisations and institutions.

African universities pay 50x more for the same bandwidth
--------------------------------------------------------

	"While a university in Germany might pay about US $4000 per month
	for 1 gigabit per second of bandwidth, a school in Kenya can expect to
	pay $200 000 for the same service." `IEEE Spectrum, Feb 2013
	<http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/internet/how-bad-is-africas-internet>`_.

.. class:: handout

How did this happen?

*	Lack of infrastructure, especially copper and fibre networks
*	Lack of competitive service providers
*	High costs of installing infrastructure
*	Long delay in investment and deregulation

Demand for bandwidth is increasing everywhere
---------------------------------------------

Abuse of shared resource hurts others
-------------------------------------

.. class:: handout

In economics, the tragedy of the commons is:

*	the depletion of a shared resource by individuals,
*	acting independently and rationally according to each one's self-interest,
*	despite their understanding that depleting the common resource is
	contrary to the group's long-term best interests.
	
This happens on a network when:

*	there is no incentive for users to limit their use of bandwidth

	* for example, financial cost, punishment, self-harm

*	users are allowed to use bandwidth to the point that it affects others
*	network or bandwidth management is not used (the default)

Shared resources always need management. More users -> more management.

Network management requires advanced skills and equipment
---------------------------------------------------------



How did this happen?
--------------------

* Historical access issues

    -  Lack of infrastructure, especially copper and fibre networks
    -  Lack of competitive service providers
    -  High costs of installing infrastructure
    -  Long delay in investment and deregulation

* Shared resources always need management

    -  Requires advanced knowledge, skills and equipment
    -  Homes, businesses and universities all need bandwidth management
    -  Hence the number of expensive products on the market!

Key findings from ATICS survey
-----------------------------------

* African university = European home
* Pays 50x more than European home
* Limited bandwidth per computer
* Always congested (over 60% of the time)
* 59% of institutions do not monitor or manage bandwidth

Note: this survey was in 2006, the results may be outdated.

Effects of bandwidth challenges
-------------------------------

* Difficulties in using Internet based information resources and communication tools

    - Digital library resources are under utilised
    - Resource license costs can be less effective
    - Free or low cost resources are difficult to take advantage of
    - The digital library revolution is difficult to participate in
    - Continued digital divide

* Under utilisation of ICT capacities and investments

    - Bandwidth charges of $5,000 per month that result in an unusable link –
      is that money well spent?
    - Infrastructure costs e.g. PC computer labs that users spend most
      of their time sitting around waiting for pages to display – is
      that money well spent?

* Impacts on a university’s core activities, especially
  those that require up to date and a wide range of information
  resources e.g. teaching and research.

Possible solutions
------------------

-  Doing nothing
-  More bandwidth and at lower cost
-  Better management of existing resource
-  Combination of the above

    - Better management and optimisation of bandwidth is essential
    - Even if bandwidth is doubled, it will still need managing to
      ensure maximum efficiency

Network Management
------------------

Other factors that affect the efficiency of IT services:

* How do you deal with complaints?

    * Can you detect and fix problems before users complain?
    * Do you have a support/complaints policy?
    * How do you escalate problems?
    * How quickly are problems handled?

* Who are your most important users?

.. class:: handout

    The objective of a support policy is to make it clear:
    
    * what is supported,
    * who is entitled to support,
    * how much they are entitled to,
    * and what they can do if they don't get it.
    
    It helps to reduce arguments between support staff and other staff
    members and students, and increase satisfaction with support.
    
    Escalation means passing on a complaint that you can't resolve yourself
    to somebody who can. That might include:
    
    * your ISP (if your connection is broken),
    * a senior executive (if someone asks for something you have no budget
      for, or feels badly treated).
    
    Identifying important users and proactively talking to them helps to
    solve problems before the user realises that there is a problem.
    
Who is responsible?
-------------------

Who needs to be involved in network management, and why?

-  Executive management
-  Senior implementation management
-  Technical staff involved in the day-to-day implementation
-  Academics, librarians and other legitimate Internet users

Group Discussion
----------------

What challenges does your institution face with network management?

What impact are they having on:

-  User satisfaction?
-  User perception of IT staff performance?
-  How the outside world sees your institution?

How are these issues being addressed within your institution?

-  Technically?
-  With policies?
-  With both?
-  If not, why not?

	* Time? Resources? Money? Wrong incentives?

You may want to nominate a group representative to capture the key points
of the discussion on a flipchart sheet.

Plenary Discussion
------------------

Please present the results of your group discussions.

* One representative, 5 minutes per group.
* Please focus on your top three-five challenges/solutions.

During the discussion of other groups’ results, please consider:

* Are there similarities with your institution?
* Are there differences?
* Are there lessons that you can learn?

Can you help?
-------------

-  What problems are you experiencing?
-  Have you found a good tool or skills?
-  Give us the benefit of your experience: especially with a successful
   problem resolution!
-  Share your knowledge with others, don't hide or sell it.
-  Build a community in your country.

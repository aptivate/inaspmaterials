  Everything that is in this block will only be in the notes.
  You can put these on each slide.

Objectives
----------

-  Identify key reasons why network traffic should be monitored
-  Discuss why continuous traffic monitoring is important
-  See if / how network traffic monitoring is being done in
   representative institutions

But firstly
-----------

-  What is the challenge being faced:

   -  Not enough bandwidth?
   -  Too costly?
   -  Need for more?

-  In reality ... in Africa ... in Universities

What is the bandwidth challenge?
--------------------------------

-  Available bandwidth is very low compared to Western universities;
-  Western online culture drives demand for more bandwidth;
-  Users' abuse of shared resource hurts others more than themselves.

How did this happen?
--------------------

* Historical access issues

    -  Lack of infrastructure, especially copper and fibre networks
    -  Lack of competitive service providers
    -  High costs of installing infrastructure
    -  Long delay in investment and deregulation

* Shared resources always need management

    -  Requires advanced knowledge, skills and equipment
    -  Homes, businesses and universities all need bandwidth management
    -  Hence the number of expensive products on the market!

Key findings from ATICS survey 2006
-----------------------------------

* African university = European home
* Pays 50x more than European home
* Limited bandwidth per computer (average was 3.36Kbps)
* Always congested (over 60% of the time)
* 59% of institutions do not monitor or manage bandwidth

Effects of bandwidth challenges
-------------------------------

* Difficulties in using Internet based information resources and communication tools

-  Digital library resources are under utilised
-  Resource license costs can be less effective
-  Free or low cost resources are difficult to take advantage of
-  The digital library revolution is difficult to participate in
-  Continued digital divide

* Under utilisation of ICT capacities and investments

-  Bandwidth charges of $5,000 per month that result in an unusable link –
   is that money well spent?
-  Infrastructure costs e.g. PC computer labs that users spend most
	of their time sitting around waiting for pages to display – is
	that money well spent?

* Impacts on a university’s core activities, especially
   those that require up to date and a wide range of information
   resources e.g. teaching and research.

Possible solutions
------------------

-  Doing nothing
-  More bandwidth and at lower cost
-  Better management of existing resource
-  Combination of the above

   -  Better management and optimisation of bandwidth is essential
   -  Even if bandwidth is doubled, it will still need managing to
      ensure maximum efficiency

Group Discussion
----------------

Can you identify the challenges your institution faces with respect to BMO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  What impact are they having on user satisfaction?
-  What impact are they having on the perception of how good an I.T.
   team your institution has?
-  What impact are they having on the outside world view of the
   institution?

Group Discussion
----------------

Are these being addressed within your institution?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Technically?
-  With policies?
-  With both?
-  If not, why not?

Bandwidth management – some comments
------------------------------------

-  Monitoring and management of the available resource
-  Optimisation of the resource to ensure value for money and fitness of
   purpose

For example:

-  Monitoring of bandwidth to know how it is being used
-  Implementation of policies to guide effective use
-  Technical tools and resources to optimise use

Who is responsible?
-------------------

Different people need to be involved in this:

-  Executive management
-  Senior implementation management
-  Technical staff involved in the day-to-day implementation
-  Academics, librarians and other legitimate Internet users

Can you help?
-------------

-  What problems are you experiencing?
-  Have you found a good tool or skills?
-  Give us the benefit of your experience: especially with a successful
   problem resolution!
-  Share your knowledge with others, don't hide or sell it.
-  Build a community in your country.

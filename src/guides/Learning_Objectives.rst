Study Guide
===========

.. include:: ../includes/Authors.rst

This is a series of workshops by INASP, Africonnect and Aptivate to help
IT staff to develop advanced, effective network management skills, including
Bandwidth Management and Optimisation.

At the end of each unit, participants may want to reflect individually on
what they have learned so far and document any point to remember and/or
follow up (expected time: 5 minutes).

In these workshops we may use terms that are unfamiliar to you. If you are
unsure of anything, please ask a facilitator, or if you are studying alone,
please try searching the Internet or asking a question on the Server Fault
website, a free "question and answer site for professional system and network
administrators".

Please also submit comments on our website to help us improve these
workshops for future participants. Thank you!

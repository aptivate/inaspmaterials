Effective Network Management
============================

Study Guide
-----------

A series of workshops by INASP, Africonnect and Aptivate to help
IT staff to develop advanced network management skills, including
Bandwidth Management and Optimisation.

.. include:: ../Authors.rst.inc

At the end of each unit, participants may want to reflect individually on
what they have learned so far and document any point to remember and/or
follow up (expected time: 5 minutes).

In these workshops we may use terms that are unfamiliar to you. If you are
unsure of anything, please ask a facilitator, or if you are studying alone,
please try searching the Internet or asking a question on the Server Fault
website, a free "question and answer site for professional system and network
administrators".

Please also submit comments on our website to help us improve these
workshops for future participants. Thank you!

Summary: We present and discuss some of the challenges that are faced in
university network management.

On completion of this session, we hope you will:

* Understand how and why African universities face challenges with:

    * available bandwidth
    * network performance
    * effectiveness of IT spending
    * resulting impact on academic objectives

* Understand the benefits of excellent network management.

* Know how these issues are currently being addressed in your own and other
  organisations and institutions.

Expected time to go through all the parts of the discussion is around 1 hour,
plus 5 minutes to write down any points you wish to remember or follow up.

Unit 2 – Why Monitor
--------------------

Summary: we try to identify why we should monitor network traffic.

Participants examine how the network management challenge has been dealt
with within their institutions (expected time: 10 minutes). Results of this
group discussion are shared with all the workshop participants (expected
time: 25 minutes).

On completion of this session, we hope you will:

* Understand why congestion happens, and causes slow page loading.

* Understand how to change users behaviour by providing the right
  incentives.
  
* Understand how monitoring helps you to create those incentives.

* Understand how monitoring can help you to improve and repair your
  network and Internet connection.
  
Advice on how to carry out monitoring is given in Unit 3.

Personal Reflection
-------------------

Please reflect on YOUR learning experience so far. You might want to focus
on the points below and make some notes for yourself.

# What have you learnt?
# What appear to be the advantages of technology-based solutions to bandwidth management and optimization?
# What appear to be the advantages of policy-based solutions to bandwidth management and optimization?
# What else would you like to know about bandwidth management and optimization?
# What resources would you need and who can provide them?
# Were there experiences in other institutions you would like to know more about? How can you follow-up?

We will be returning to thinking about and possibly addressing these points throughout the workshop so it might be advisable to keep some space per point.



Identified key reasons why network traffic should be monitored
Discussed why continuous traffic monitoring is important

At the end of each unit, participants may want to reflect individually on
what they have learned so far and document any point to remember and/or
follow up (expected time: 5 minutes).

In these workshops we may use terms that are unfamiliar to you. If you are
unsure of anything, please ask a facilitator, or if you are studying alone,
please try searching the Internet or asking a question on the Server Fault
website, a free "question and answer site for professional system and network
administrators".

Please also submit comments on our website to help us improve these
workshops for future participants. Thank you!

Summary: Firstly we have to understand some of the challenges that are
faced in network management, using a presentation and discussion.

On completion of this session, we hope you will:

* Understand how and why African universities face challenges with:

    * available bandwidth
    * network performance
    * effectiveness of IT spending
    * resulting impact on academic objectives

* Understand why other universities also face these challenges, and how
  they address them (or not).

* Understand the benefits of excellent network management, and why it is
  so important to all universities.

* Know who is responsible for different aspects of implementing excellent
  network management in a university.

* Understand how these issues are currently being addressed in the
  organisation/institution.

Expected time to go through all the parts of the discussion is around 1 hour,
plus 5 minutes to write down any points you wish to remember or follow up.

Unit 2 – Why Monitor
--------------------

Summary: we try to identify why we should monitor network traffic.
Participants examine how the network management challenge has been dealt
with within their institutions (expected time: 10 minutes). Results of this
group discussion are shared with all the workshop participants (expected
time: 25 minutes).

Advice on how to carry out each activity is given in Unit 3.

On completion of this session, we hope you will:



Identified key reasons why network traffic should be monitored
Discussed why continuous traffic monitoring is important

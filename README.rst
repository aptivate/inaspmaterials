Network Management Workshops
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This is a series of workshops by
`INASP <http://www.inasp.info/>`_, `Africonnect <http://africonnect.com/>`_
and `Aptivate <http://www.aptivate.org/>`_ to help IT staff to develop
advanced, effective network management skills, including Bandwidth
Management and Optimisation.

The series is divided into workshop units. The units should make sense
individually, although they may occasionally refer to other units.
Each unit is available in several formats, for different learning approaches.
All formats are automatically generated from the same source code, written
in `ReStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.

*	**Presentations** are intended to be shown on a projector to a large
	audience.
  
	We provide them as
	`OpenOffice Impress <http://www.openoffice.org/product/impress.html>`_-compatible
	ODP files, which you can `use <http://superuser.com/q/84480/116323>`_ with
	Microsoft PowerPoint 2007, or older versions with a
	`plugin <http://odf-converter.sourceforge.net/>`_. Many slides have
	speaker notes giving more details and references to help the presenter.
	
	In future we might provide Slidy or similar HTML presentations as well.
	PDF does not appear to properly support speaker notes, losing much of the
	value of the presentations.

*	**Chapters** are intended to be read, like chapters of a book, for
	self-study. Presenters might also prefer them over the presenter notes
	embedded in the ODP files.
	
	We provide them as PDF files, and HTML rendered by Github.

Please submit comments on our website, or create
`issues <https://github.com/aptivate/inaspmaterials/issues>`_, or fork and
modify these resources on `Github <https://github.com/aptivate/inaspmaterials>`_,
to help us improve them for future participants. Thank you! These materials
